Deliver a system that implements a light oscillating L\+ED. The L\+ED will be oscillating its intensity in two ways\+:

Light intensity will be oscillating in a sinusoidal pattern, in the range of 0\% to 100\% intensity Every period of the sinusoidal wave generated, the frequency f of oscillation will be increased by 0.\+1 i.\+e. f+=0.\+1f, with a max frequency of 10f, and min frequency f. When max frequency is reached, f starts decrementing by 0.\+1 i.\+e. f-\/=0.\+1f, until min frequency is reached, then the pattern starts again. Set f to 1Hz, therefore 10f is 10Hz In order to vary the intensity it is necessary to generate a P\+WM signal, in which the duty cycle maps to the light intensity. It is given then, that the L\+ED must be connected to a Timer output (for which the P\+WM signal will be generated).

There are 2 mini milestones\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Generate the sine wave of any frequency (visible obviously), varying the intensity of the L\+ED using P\+WM
\item Connect a L\+ED to a Timer output, and toggle the L\+ED with the following progression\+: On 1 sec, Off 1/1.\+1 secs, On 1/1.\+2 secs, Off 1/1.\+3 secs, .... until On 1/10 secs, then revert progression as\+: On 1/10 secs, Off 1/9.\+9 secs, On 1/9.\+8 secs, .... until On 1sec
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Deliverables are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A video showing the code being compiled and downloaded to the S\+T\+M32 board through the S\+T-\/\+Link programmer, and the light oscillating starting in 1Hz, going to 10Hz and coming back to 1Hz. The video shall be uploaded to youtube
\item The source code and the Makefile to compile the two mini milestones and the final deliverable
